{{< ingredients >}}

* Used Cabot cheddar instead of mozzarella

{{< instructions duration="1 hour" >}}

We picked this recipe on short notice because we were still hungry after a light lunch (and somebody doesn't believe in buying snacks to have on hand for times like these). ONE hour of total prep time (and probably faster if you make it all the time:
10 minutes of mixing
15 minutes of resting
20 minutes of shaping it into 4 rounds, which will ultimately make 2 cheesy quesidillas
20-24 minutes of baking (10-12 if you don't count the eating time while the second one bakes for those who are only using one round baking pan at a time)

We used a mix that included some spicy cheese. I'm going to ask to try adding small diced sweet peppers and/or mushrooms next time; as I type this, also thinking this would be a good way to use up any leftover ham from holiday dinners.
