Pairs well with goat cheese

We spontaneously chose this recipe on a Sunday afternoon without any planning because of it's quick cook time: ONE hour in total! We ended up pairing it some other foodstuffs we had on hand for a lovely dinner: frozen flounder and salad package kit -> made for fish flatbread tacos that were on level with a food truck. The flatbread had a nice soft bouncy texture that paired really well with the crispy salad and the fried flaky flounder. Recommend an acidic/citrus dressing - makes the dish pop - if you're going to try this combination out.
