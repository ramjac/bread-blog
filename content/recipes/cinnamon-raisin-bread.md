2/8/25: The day before the big KC vs Philly Superbown showdown. This was the first recipe from the Big Book of Bread bake-along. Why this one? An excess of raisins in the home and no prolonged rise time. Unfortunately, that's about all the praise I can offer for this recipe. Relatively simple and fast. Probably because it's so boring. Despite the exciting kickoff of this baking adventure and the prospects of potentially bringing this to our friends' Superbowl party, I admittedly slept through the baking and awakened to a regular slightly sweet swirl bread that I couldn't differentiate from store-bought varieties. It tasted better with a schmear of peanut butter on it, which tells you how it doesn't really stand alone well. Bake it if you need something easy and to use up raisins.
