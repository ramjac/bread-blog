For anyone who is familiar with the King Arthur cinnamon star bread, this is a savory version. It's always a crowd pleaser too for social gatherings or giving away to a neighbor because of its eye-catching appearance and pull-away convenience. Also, for those who haven't tried a bialy bread yet, this is similar, except lighter and slightly sweeter. 

Side note on bialy, to save time for those who might otherwise have been inspired to Google it. They're like baked (as opposed to boiled) bagels with a crater rather than a whole in the middle traditionally filled with diced onion flavored with poppy seeds and garlic.
